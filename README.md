The project was a school project that required the use of JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, and HTML for the front end, and SpringMVC for the back end. 

It is an employment platform, we can add, alter, delete ,query the employment information. Also with a login page. Use mysql database.

The team consisted of six members: two focused on front-end development, three on back-end development, and one on documentation. 

I served as the project manager, overseeing the project's progress and leading the front-end development.
